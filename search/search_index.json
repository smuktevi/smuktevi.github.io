If you could climb that mountain, you could probably do anything, right?</p> <p>What if you work hard? For years, you really struggle and persevere through rigorous training. All in an effort to scale the highest mountain in the world. And when you get to the very top, there's already a hoard of people there. Maybe they are welcoming you. Would you feel happy for having made it with all these people and celebrate with them? Or would you feel ashamed that you were late to the party. Looks like many already did what you thought was the greatest thing you could do. Is there nothing unique about you now? Which should you feel? Which is the \"right\" feeling to have?</p> <p>The \"right\" thing to feel might be joy that there are people at the top, acknowledging you in as one of their own. You can celebrate with them as equals and share stories of achievements through dedication and hard work. This might reinforce a positive outlook and act as a source of motivation for you going forward. All is well, so onward to the next Everest.</p> <p>What if you feel otherwise? You hate yourself for not being up to the mark, for not being the first one there. You loath the fact that there are so many that have already proven some remarkable feat to be quite easily achievable by many people. You see others only as competition and are not satisfied. You want to be more. Be greater. Onward to the next Everest.</p> <p>That isn't a great feeling. May be why it's better to look within. Fight and compete with and within yourself. Where only you bear witness to your greatness. But that seems like a superpower. Where happiness comes from within. Something I think a lot of us wish we would be feeling instead. Beating your personal best instead of being the best person.</p> <p>So which is it?  Do we fight to be greater on the outside by receiving acknowledgments of success or do we fight within to achieve happiness through simpler satisfaction?</p> <p>I think one of these comes more naturally to us than the other. One seems like a long road to happiness and the other much shorter. So I think... happiness is not the goal here?</p>"},{"location":"blog/posts/post2_dataSeers.html","title":"Data See-er","text":"<p>Sep 28, 2023</p> <p>The word History immediately takes me back to snuggling up into a ball as a child and wondering in awe as I read a book on great historical figures and places in a dimly lit corner of the public library. It's no joke when they say these picturesque books, made for kids at that age, would jump start your imagination. To wander across the halls of the Pharaohs, the pirates and the stories of fancy kings and brave queens. You would picture them praying to their fierce but intriguing Gods or discovering exquisitely described places of awesome power. All of this making your vivid imagination run wild while the words and pictures flow off the pages and into your mind's eye. Not knowing where the fact began and the fiction ended. The further back the history the more mythical the events that occurred.</p> <p>Oracles, prophets, seers or wise ones with gifts of foresight often played a big role in these old stories. Being able to predict the downfall of a great dynasty or using sticks and stones to tell you of a great war as they say. I often wonder if these were the precursors to a great field of science that you and I are more familiar with today. When someone decided to (rather smartly) predict some macro-scale event by utilizing the information available to them making it seem like some other-worldly voodoo.</p> <p>As I imagine it, someone must've collected all this relevant information and transferred it into the universal language of Mathematics. Then converted that math into an understanding of systems by using intelligent tricks. This enabled them to see how small things affected other things and how other things affected the more important things. All in leading us down to this very moment where we can now say if it can be sunny, rainy or windy tomorrow, or if a basketball team is going to win their next game, if a natural disaster is bound to occur, or what product is listed to be the next hottest thing on the market.</p> <p>It started with being able to gather valuable information and making logical guesses about events. For example,</p> <p>My friend was supposed to run a 5K track event tomorrow evening.  He is very competitive and won last year, so he has to defend his title.  I bet you a 100% he's going to run.  Oh, wait, he told me he doesn't feel like running and wants to take up another sport.  80% chance he'll run? He feels like he's coming down with the flu.  50% chance?  He tripped and sprained his ankle. 0%.  </p> <p>The more information I got about my friend the closer I got to \"guesstimating\" a certain outcome. Now imagine this at a larger scale. When you take all these bits and pieces of information together under a common theme or domain, and you have data. And when you know all the different moving parts in this system, where conditional probabilities take into effect, then you can put an exact quantitative value on the probability of a predicted outcome. The quality of your information will determine the quality of your predictions. The longer you spend on making sure your sources are genuine without malpractice, the more trust you can place in your foresight.</p> <p>As you can see, people have been studying the art and science of prediction for ages. </p> <p>Xerxes I, also known as Xerxes the Great, ruled the Persian Empire from 486 BCE to 465 BCE. Herodotus mentions in his account that the great Persian king was told by Pythias, a court seer, that if Xerxes invaded Greece, \"a great empire\" would be destroyed. The story as accounted by Herodotus goes to saying Pythias did not specify exactly which empire would be destroyed. The king prepared a massive force to invade Greece believing that the prediction referred to the Greek city-states. In the end, Xerxes and his armies suffered great defeat at the hands of the Greek forces that also included the well-known Spartans.</p> <p>Fast-forward a bit.</p> <p>Many financial institutions and economists utilize complex algorithms to predict the health of the global economy and markets. The housing market was \"booming\" and everyone was buying in. All these models showed low risk and great opportunities for investments. All that misplaced faith, lack of accounting for everything important and misleading data played a significant role leading into the financial crisis of '07-'08 that many didn't see coming. </p> <p>Just trying to draw parallels in the instance of placing your belief in these seers or data professionals. There is no guaranteed 100% accuracy out there. There's always risks involved.</p> <p>Maybe we haven't come far enough to completely place our faith in our ability to predict events or outcomes. I may be biased. And where there is bias, there is distorted perspective, selective reasoning, misunderstandings and ignorance.</p> <p>It's fascinating though how these complex predictive systems have evolved so much and have become so well integrated in our daily lives that we don't even notice them at play sometimes. We've come a long way since Xerxes, and I'm stuck in wanting to imagine that these seers actually had some mathematical intuition involved in their foresight. Maybe using some key information and to calculate probabilities of events. If not quantitatively, maybe in very lengthy <code>if-else</code> blocks of contemporary historical context and well-sourced gossip. </p> <p>Information is the most valuable asset.</p> <p>What if we could ponder on an age where we are able to predict things to an exactness of happening. Where there is no fear of the unknown because all is now known. There is no wondering, only waiting.</p> <p>Actually, that seems even more terrifying to me...</p>"},{"location":"blog/posts/tech2_optimization.html","title":"Optimization in Machine Learning","text":"<p>Aug 4, 2023</p> <p>Here's a short essay I wrote on my learnings about basic optimization techniques used in machine learning gathered as my own notes from a couple papers. The following is the introduction and the link if it further piques your interests to delve into.</p> <p>...</p> <p>Optimization is at the heart of all machine learning and drives the learning process forward. We usually  must predict our dependent variable by feeding independent variables into an algorithm. This will result  in an error term which can be portrayed as the difference in the dependent variable values and the  prediction values. The optimization process takes over in this context to reduce the error in prediction  as speedily and efficiently as possible to get closer to predicting the right values for the dependent  variable. In this way the model fits the data. Optimization can be described as tuning the parameters  involved in the learning process to achieve the highest possible standard of prediction according to the  decided metrics. </p> <p>While pursuing machine learning, it is critical to understand the importance of the optimization  techniques being used. Often, we are introduced to these topics very gently while discussing the steps  involved in a machine learning algorithm. I have not seen the depth and breadth of optimization being  explored in these initial stages of learning which I believe is crucial knowledge to gain a better  understanding of the algorithms that work in machine learning. This was the main reason why I chose to  dig deeper into optimization techniques.</p> <p>To appreciate the underlying principles of which powerful, effective, and generalized machine learning  models are built upon, to look at the evolution of these techniques and to also learn more about  Backpropagation and other such significant algorithms that have greatly contributed to machine  learning today.</p> <p>This essay is aimed at diving into optimization methods pertaining to machine learning algorithms. This  essay is targeted for those who are learning machine learning techniques and would like to understand  the breadth of optimization methods and fundamentals. We will also have a brief discussion on Backpropagation towards the end. The scope of this essay is bounded by my study and may be biased  according to the references used. The aim is to compile the readings and insights of various research  papers, book extracts, blogs and articles covering this topic that I have come across during my study. I  also apologize for the use of personal opinions without knowledgeable backing or any ambiguity if  found.</p> <p>This is essay will discuss the following topics. First, we will try to get a glimpse of the evolution of  problem-solving using optimization before filtering in on the machine learning context. We will then  build a foundation on some of the basics of optimization and look into popular Cost Functions which are  objective functions being optimized in machine learning algorithms. Then we will take a brief look at  numerical analysis with Newton\u2019s method, the ultimate predecessor of optimization algorithms. After  that, we will explore gradient-based optimization methods, which are the most widely used type in  machine learning. This will conclude our summary on the fundamentals and the background of  optimization techniques. Then we can freely indulge in discussion of notable and interesting topics  integrated with optimization in machine learning. The all-powerful Backpropagation will be the center of  our discussion. Finally, we conclude with some findings, personal thoughts and next steps in further studies.</p> <p>It is important to note that all topics in this essay will not be explained in great detail, but I will  try to lay out the most interesting material and some basics that I have learned from this study. I hope  to answer questions and discuss topics that are on the minds of fresh technological aspirants as well as  capture the interests of those with prior knowledge. </p> Link to paper"},{"location":"notes/index.html","title":"Notes","text":"<p>Ramblings, thoughts, TILs and more.</p> <p> I want to make it clear that all my material on this website is made accessible so that I can maybe help start a discussion here, get some feedback there and learn a little everywhere.

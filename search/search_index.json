Sai also has a SWE background which enables him to not only take on analytics role but also capable of delving into the engineering aspect of the Data Science Work. Aside from technical know-how, Sai also has a long-term plan for his career development. From my 1:1 with him, he can clearly articulate what his career interests are and viable paths to reach the goal. For someone relatively new to the realm of DS, this type of forward planning will be a big contributing factor in his eventual success. </p> <p>All in all, I think any data science team would be lucky to have him on the team.\"</p> <p>...</p>"},{"location":"about.html#luan-jiang-data-and-applied-scientist-at-microsoft-september-29-2021","title":"Luan Jiang \u00b7 Data and Applied Scientist at Microsoft \u00b7 September 29, 2021","text":"<p>\"Sai interned on my team at Microsoft during the summer of 2021 and his internship project was a great success. </p> <p>Sai has solid technical skills and is a quick learner.

He was able to manage both the workload from NTWIST and his course while being successful at both. Along with this he was able to co-create a machine learning solution for an industrial process.

With all the hype surrounding data science and AI in today's world it's important for me to ask; do we even need data science here or is the solution much simpler. Today I work as a data scientist helping stakeholders really define their problems comprehensively before diving into my arsenal of skills to provide them with a solution.  The power of data in today's world is ubiquitous. It's not even just about who can accumulate the most amount of data but more about who can extract the most valuable information. Using this valuable information to uncover useful facts and communicating those facts to those who seek it is a data professional's calling.</p> <p>...</p> <p>Imagining and building things from the ground up is extremely satisfying.

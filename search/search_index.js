Aside from technical know-how, Sai also has a long-term plan for his career development. From my 1:1 with him, he can clearly articulate what his career interests are and viable paths to reach the goal.

Today I work as a data scientist helping stakeholders really define their problems comprehensively before diving into my arsenal of skills to provide them with a solution.  The power of data in today's world is ubiquitous. It's not even just about who can accumulate the most amount of data but more about who can extract the most valuable information.

We performed our analysis using the Kaggle dataset of the Crunchbase 2014 snapshot, which includes approximated 50,000 companies. We found that the average amount of money raised, and the average number of funding rounds, both vary by industry. We concluded that the average amount of seed money invested is increasing by 13.5% annually. We also found, controversially, that companies that did not have seed rounds are 4 times more likely to have a venture round. Our results should be received with caution, as our dataset included strong survivorship, regional, and market bias.</p> Learn More Visualizing The Hunger Project in Africa UW Data Visualization T <p>his project is an interactive visualization centered around illustrating the organizational activities of The Hunger Project (THP) in Africa. We aim to represent the work done by THP and its journey over the years through a visual storytelling approach. The targeted audience includes potential donors to THP, members of THP, and anyone interested in learning more about THP activities.      My biggest take away from this project was learning how to visualize and find patterns in real world data. Often real world data is very messy and incomplete. It is very important that we convey the information that we can understand from the data in a correct representation so as to not misguide viewers or give chances for misinterpretation.     </p> Learn More LyriQuest RIT Capstone O <p>ur project aims at enhancing the experience for sound cataloguing by employing methods to further classify music as well as giving a description about the lyrics. People listen to music in order to feel certain emotions and express joy and sadness. This application will help users select music based on their mood. The software uses various modules to fulfill the operating requirements. It employs the help of song fingerprinting, machine learning, and data science in order to recommend songs, draw graphs, and give analysis on the type of music a person listens to based on song lyrics data. Users will have access to a quick description about the topics and emotions in a song so that they can make a quick judgment on whether to include the track on their playlist.     </p> Learn More PipedUp High School Capstone D <p>esigned and developed a game in C++ using OOPS concepts in Turbo C++.

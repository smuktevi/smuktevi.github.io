If you could climb that mountain, you could probably do anything, right?</p> <p>What if you work hard? For years, you really struggle and persevere through rigorous training. All in an effort to scale the highest mountain in the world. And when you get to the very top, there's already a hoard of people there. Maybe they are welcoming you. Would you feel happy for having made it with all these people and celebrate with them? Or would you feel ashamed that you were late to the party. Looks like many already did what you thought was the greatest thing you could do. Is there nothing unique about you now? Which should you feel? Which is the \"right\" feeling to have?</p> <p>The \"right\" thing to feel might be joy that there are people at the top, acknowledging you in as one of their own. You can celebrate with them as equals and share stories of achievements through dedication and hard work. This might reinforce a positive outlook and act as a source of motivation for you going forward. All is well, so onward to the next Everest.</p> <p>What if you feel otherwise? You hate yourself for not being up to the mark, for not being the first one there. You loath the fact that there are so many that have already proven some remarkable feat to be quite easily achievable by many people. You see others only as competition and are not satisfied. You want to be more. Be greater. Onward to the next Everest.</p> <p>That isn't a great feeling. May be why it's better to look within. Fight and compete with and within yourself. Where only you bear witness to your greatness. But that seems like a superpower. Where happiness comes from within. Something I think a lot of us wish we would be feeling instead. Beating your personal best instead of being the best person.</p> <p>So which is it?  Do we fight to be greater on the outside by receiving acknowledgments of success or do we fight within to achieve happiness through simpler satisfaction?</p> <p>I think one of these comes more naturally to us than the other. One seems like a long road to happiness and the other much shorter. So I think... happiness is not the goal here?</p>"},{"location":"blog/posts/post2_perspectives.html","title":"Perspectives","text":"<p>Aug 4, 2023</p> <p>post is cooking :)</p>"},{"location":"blog/posts/tech1_dataSeer.html","title":"Data See-er","text":"<p>Sep 28, 2023</p> <p>The word History immediately takes me back to snuggling up into a ball as a child and wondering in awe as I read a book on great historical figures and places in a dimly lit corner of the public library. It's no joke when they say these picturesque books, made for kids at that age, would jump start your imagination. To wander across the halls of the Pharaohs, the pirates and the stories of fancy kings and brave queens. You would picture them praying to their fierce but intriguing Gods or discovering exquisitely described places of awesome power. All of this making your vivid imagination run wild while the words and pictures flew off the pages and into your mind's eye. Not knowing where the fact began and the fiction ended. The further back the history the more mythical the events that occurred.</p> <p>Oracles, prophets, seers or wise ones with gifts of foresight often played a big role in these old stories. Being able to predict the downfall of a great dynasty or using sticks and stones to tell you of a great war as they say. I often wonder if these were the precursors to a great field of science that you and I are more familiar with today. When someone decided to (rather smartly) predict some macro-scale event by utilizing the information available to them making it seem like some other-worldly voodoo.</p> <p>As I imagine it, someone must've collected all this relevant information and transferred it into a universal language of mathematical and logical reasoning. This enabled them to see how things affected other things and how other things affected the more important things. All in leading us down to today, where we can now say if it can be sunny, rainy or windy tomorrow, or if a basketball team is going to win their next game, if a natural disaster is bound to occur, or what product is listed to be the next hottest thing in the market.</p> <p>Looking at it from a base level perspective, it could've started with being able to gather valuable information and making logical guesses about some simple events. </p> <p>My friend was supposed to run a 5K track event tomorrow evening.  He is very competitive and won last year, so he has to defend his title.  I bet you a 100% he's going to run.  Oh, wait, he didn't want to run himself but was forced to by the school. 95% chance he'll run.     He told me he doesn't feel like running.  80% chance he'll run? He may have a class to attend around that time.  50% chance?  He broke his leg this morning.  0%.  </p> <p>The more information I got about my friend the closer we got to \"guesstimating\" a certain outcome. Now imagine this at a larger scale. When you take all these bits and pieces of information together under a common theme or domain, you have data. And when you know all the different moving parts in this system of causality, where conditional probabilities take into effect, then you can put an exact quantitative value on the probability of a predicted outcome. The quality of your information will determine the quality of your predictions. The longer you spend on making sure your sources are genuine without malpractice, the more trust you can place in your foresight.</p> <p>As you can see, people have been studying the art and science of prediction for ages. </p> <p>Xerxes I, also known as Xerxes the Great, ruled the Persian Empire from 486 BCE to 465 BCE. Herodotus mentions in his account that the great Persian king was told by Pythias, a court seer, that if Xerxes invaded Greece, \"a great empire\" would be destroyed. The story as accounted by Herodotus goes to saying Pythias did not specify exactly which empire would be destroyed. The king prepared a massive force to invade Greece believing that the prediction referred to the Greek city-states. In the end, Xerxes and his armies suffered great defeat at the hands of the Greek forces that also included the well-known Spartans.</p> <p>Fast-forward a bit.</p> <p>Many financial institutions and economists utilize complex algorithms to predict the health of the global economy and markets. The housing market was \"booming\" and everyone was buying in. All these models showed low risk and great opportunities for investments. All that misplaced faith and misleading data played a significant role leading into the financial crisis of '07-'08. </p> <p>Just trying to draw parallels in the instance of placing your belief in these seers and data professionals. There is no guaranteed 100% accuracy out there. There's always risks involved. </p> <p>Me, mentioning these examples, and you, probably having come across many more such stories, might have persuaded some of us into thinking that we haven't come far enough to completely place our faith in our ability to predict events or outcomes. Also mind you, a classic example of bias at play here where someone like me brings out only the negatives of such attempts to foresee what could or would happen. A lot of good has come from our predictive abilities too. Where there is bias, there is distorted perspective, selective reasoning, misunderstandings and ignorance.</p> <p>It's fascinating though how these complex predictive systems have evolved so much and have become so well integrated in our daily lives that we don't even notice them at play sometimes. We've come a long way since Xerxes. I'm stuck in wanting to imagine that these seers actually used some key information and some mathematical modeling to calculate said probabilities of events. If not probabilities in numbers maybe in very lengthy <code>if-else</code> blocks of contemporary historical context. </p> <p>There is so much to learn and improve on. I am led to believe that knowledge has always been the one true power to dispel ignorance, provide us with clarity and perspective to make better well-informed decisions that govern outcomes. Information is the most valuable asset.</p> <p>I'd like to ponder on an age where we are able to predict things to an exactness of happening. Where there is no fear of the unknown because all is now known. There is no wondering, only waiting. </p> <p>That seems even more terrifying to me for some reason...</p>"},{"location":"blog/posts/tech2_optimization.html","title":"Optimization in Machine Learning","text":"<p>Aug 4, 2023</p> <p>Here's a link to a short paper I wrote on my learnings about basic optimization techniques used in machine learning gathered as my own notes from a couple papers.</p> Link to paper"},{"location":"notes/index.html","title":"Notes","text":"<p>Ramblings, thoughts, TILs and more.</p> <p> I want to make it clear that all my material on this website is made accessible so that I can maybe help start a discussion here, get some feedback there and learn a little everywhere.

It is a system where I utilized and built on a version of the TSAR architecture, that I developed back in college, to ingest social media feedback on Microsoft products and produce a tableau dashboard that could help product customer success managers make better informed decisions and help feature engineers reiterate on useful features of the product. I propsed and lead a team of engineers, data scientists, customer success managers and product managers from across organizations in microsoft including Xbox, Microsoft Office, Windows and Web Exeperiences.  <p>The goal was to find issues and feedback about products on social media, perform competitive analysis and assess new feature launches.</p> Learn More TSAR &amp; BEReddiT UW Capstone Project sponsored by Meta Python | BERT Embeddings | BERTopic | Reddit APIs | Plotly | Dash App | Heroku      The TSAR System is a data science and engineering methodology that utilizes Natural Language Processing and APIs to analyze internet forum discussions. It performs topic modeling, sentiment analysis and measures relevance of comments to discussions to extract information from social media forums. Here we implement the TSAR methodology to Reddit data using APIs and the resulting implementation is an application we call BEReddiT. We analyze over 50 subreddits with about 10,000 comments and a 1,000 posts from each subreddit. <p>The goal was to see if we can identify conflict in these forums to help social media moderators assess issues without having to look at each and every post or comment. Also to provide a means of allowing users to assess the \"toxicity\" of a subreddit culture before participating in the discussion.</p> Learn More Statistical Analysis on Startup Funding Data UW Applied Statistics Project R     This study reviews several questions of interest for entrepreneurs as well as investors about Start-up organizations. We performed our analysis using the Kaggle dataset of the Crunchbase 2014 snapshot, which includes approximated 50,000 companies. We found that the average amount of money raised, and the average number of funding rounds, both vary by industry. <p>We concluded that the average amount of seed money invested is increasing by 13.5% annually. We also found, controversially, that companies that did not have seed rounds are 4 times more likely to have a venture round.

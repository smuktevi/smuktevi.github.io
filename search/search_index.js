With all the hype surrounding data science and AI in today's world it's important for me to ask; do we even need data science here or is the solution much simpler. Today I work as a data scientist helping stakeholders really define their problems comprehensively before diving into my arsenal of skills to provide them with a solution.  The power of data in today's world is ubiquitous. It's not even just about who can accumulate the most amount of data but more about who can extract the most valuable information. Using this valuable information to uncover useful facts and communicating those facts to those who seek it is a data professional's calling.</p> <p>...</p> <p>Imagining and building things from the ground up is extremely satisfying. I think that the satisfaction of seeing something take shape and function straight from the mind is amazing. I'm happy that I have a lot more to learn and experience while on this journey as a data and software professional and I will strive to build and learn more along this path. </p>"},{"location":"projects/welcome.html","title":"Projects","text":"<p>For now, I consider projects as anything that I've worked on that I found to be a fun learning experience.</p> BEReddiT+TSAR T <p>he TSAR System is a complex data engineering pipeline that utilizes Natural Language Processing to analyze internet forum discussions using dedicated APIs depending on the source of data.

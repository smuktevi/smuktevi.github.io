# Data See-er
**Sep 28, 2023**

The word History immediately takes me back to snuggling up into a ball as a child and wondering in awe as I read a book on great historical figures and places in a dimly lit corner of the public library. It's no joke when they say these picturesque books, made for kids at that age, would jump start your imagination. To wander across the halls of the Pharaohs, the pirates and the stories of fancy kings and brave queens. You would picture them praying to their fierce but intriguing Gods or discovering exquisitely described places of awesome power. All of this making your vivid imagination run wild while the words and pictures flow off the pages and into your mind's eye. Not knowing where the fact began and the fiction ended. The further back the history the more mythical the events that occurred.

Oracles, prophets, seers or wise ones with gifts of foresight often played a big role in these old stories. Being able to predict the downfall of a great dynasty or using sticks and stones to tell you of a great war as they say. I often wonder if these were the precursors to a great field of science that you and I are more familiar with today. When someone decided to (rather smartly) predict some macro-scale event by utilizing the information available to them making it seem like some other-worldly voodoo.

As I imagine it, someone must've collected all this relevant information and transferred it into the universal language of Mathematics. Then converted that math into an understanding of systems by using intelligent tricks. This enabled them to see how small things affected other things and how other things affected the more important things. All in leading us down to this very moment where we can now say if it can be sunny, rainy or windy tomorrow, or if a basketball team is going to win their next game, if a natural disaster is bound to occur, or what product is listed to be the next hottest thing on the market.

It started with being able to gather valuable information and making logical guesses about events. For example,

> My friend was supposed to run a 5K track event tomorrow evening.   
> He is very competitive and won last year, so he has to defend his title.   
> I bet you a 100% he's going to run.   
> Oh, wait, he told me he doesn't feel like running and wants to take up another sport.   
> 80% chance he'll run?  
> He feels like he's coming down with the flu.   
> 50% chance?   
> He tripped and sprained his ankle.  
> 0%.  

The more information I got about my friend the closer I got to "guesstimating" a certain outcome. Now imagine this at a larger scale. When you take all these bits and pieces of information together under a common theme or domain, and you have data. And when you know all the different moving parts in this system, where conditional probabilities take into effect, then you can put an exact quantitative value on the probability of a predicted outcome. The quality of your information will determine the quality of your predictions. The longer you spend on making sure your sources are genuine without malpractice, the more trust you can place in your foresight.

As you can see, people have been studying the art and science of prediction for ages. 

> Xerxes I, also known as Xerxes the Great, ruled the Persian Empire from 486 BCE to 465 BCE. Herodotus mentions in his account that the great Persian king was told by Pythias, a court seer, that if Xerxes invaded Greece, "a great empire" would be destroyed. The story as accounted by Herodotus goes to saying Pythias did not specify exactly which empire would be destroyed. The king prepared a massive force to invade Greece believing that the prediction referred to the Greek city-states. In the end, Xerxes and his armies suffered great defeat at the hands of the Greek forces that also included the well-known Spartans.

Fast-forward a bit.

> Many financial institutions and economists utilize complex algorithms to predict the health of the global economy and markets. The housing market was "booming" and everyone was buying in. All these models showed low risk and great opportunities for investments. All that misplaced faith, lack of accounting for everything important and misleading data played a significant role leading into the financial crisis of '07-'08 that many didn't see coming. 

Just trying to draw parallels in the instance of placing your belief in these seers or data professionals. There is no guaranteed 100% accuracy out there. There's always risks involved.

Maybe we haven't come far enough to completely place our faith in our ability to predict events or outcomes. I may be biased. And where there is bias, there is distorted perspective, selective reasoning, misunderstandings and ignorance.

It's fascinating though how these complex predictive systems have evolved so much and have become so well integrated in our daily lives that we don't even notice them at play sometimes. We've come a long way since Xerxes, and I'm stuck in wanting to imagine that these seers actually had some mathematical intuition involved in their foresight. Maybe using some key information and to calculate probabilities of events. If not quantitatively, maybe in very lengthy `if-else` blocks of contemporary historical context and well-sourced gossip. 

Information is the most valuable asset.

What if we could ponder on an age where we are able to predict things to an exactness of happening. Where there is no fear of the unknown because all is now known. There is no wondering, only waiting.

Actually, that seems even more terrifying to me...

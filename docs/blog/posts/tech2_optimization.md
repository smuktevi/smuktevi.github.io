# Optimization in Machine Learning
***Aug 4, 2023***

Here's a short essay I wrote on my learnings about basic optimization techniques used in machine learning gathered as my own notes from a couple papers.
The following is the introduction and the link if it further piques your interests to delve into.

Optimization is at the heart of all machine learning and drives the learning process forward. We usually 
must predict our dependent variable by feeding independent variables into an algorithm. This will result 
in an error term which can be portrayed as the difference in the dependent variable values and the 
prediction values. The optimization process takes over in this context to reduce the error in prediction 
as speedily and efficiently as possible to get closer to predicting the right values for the dependent 
variable. In this way the model fits the data. Optimization can be described as tuning the parameters 
involved in the learning process to achieve the highest possible standard of prediction according to the 
decided metrics. 
  
While pursuing machine learning, it is critical to understand the importance of the optimization 
techniques being used. Often, we are introduced to these topics very gently while discussing the steps 
involved in a machine learning algorithm. I have not seen the depth and breadth of optimization being 
explored in these initial stages of learning which I believe is crucial knowledge to gain a better 
understanding of the algorithms that work in machine learning. This was the main reason why I chose to 
dig deeper into optimization techniques.
  
To appreciate the underlying principles of which powerful, effective, and generalized machine learning 
models are built upon, to look at the evolution of these techniques and to also learn more about 
Backpropagation and other such significant algorithms that have greatly contributed to machine 
learning today.

This essay is aimed at diving into optimization methods pertaining to machine learning algorithms. This 
essay is targeted for those who are learning machine learning techniques and would like to understand 
the breadth of optimization methods and fundamentals. We will also have a brief discussion on
Backpropagation towards the end. The scope of this essay is bounded by my study and may be biased 
according to the references used. The aim is to compile the readings and insights of various research 
papers, book extracts, blogs and articles covering this topic that I have come across during my study. I 
also apologize for the use of personal opinions without knowledgeable backing or any ambiguity if 
found.
  
This is essay will discuss the following topics. First, we will try to get a glimpse of the evolution of 
problem-solving using optimization before filtering in on the machine learning context. We will then 
build a foundation on some of the basics of optimization and look into popular Cost Functions which are 
objective functions being optimized in machine learning algorithms. Then we will take a brief look at 
numerical analysis with Newtonâ€™s method, the ultimate predecessor of optimization algorithms. After 
that, we will explore gradient-based optimization methods, which are the most widely used type in 
machine learning. This will conclude our summary on the fundamentals and the background of 
optimization techniques. Then we can freely indulge in discussion of notable and interesting topics 
integrated with optimization in machine learning. The all-powerful Backpropagation will be the center of 
our discussion. Finally, we conclude with some findings, personal thoughts and next steps in further
studies.
  
It is important to note that all topics in this essay will not be explained in great detail, but I will 
try to lay out the most interesting material and some basics that I have learned from this study. I hope 
to answer questions and discuss topics that are on the minds of fresh technological aspirants as well as 
capture the interests of those with prior knowledge.

# Dear Readers,
***02/08/2023***

<p class="initial-letter">
<span>I</span> must say, after making it this far, I still feel like things are just beginning for me. I have so much more to learn and experience along this journey while building out my career brick by brick. I'm grateful that I have more room to grow and I'm confident in my abilities to do so. I wouldn't call myself an expert in data science, software, technology or the IT industry. I just think it's fun and exciting and I'm happy to be a part of this fast-paced evolving data tech world. I just want to understand it better and share that with everyone. I have imposter syndrome daily - just gives me more fuel to work extra hard. I'm doing this to assess my understanding and articulate that in my writing. I believe it will help me become a better writer. </p>

<p>Growing up I was taught to write and learn. It helps me reflect on my understanding of things and gives me calrity on where I'm lacking. I want to become a better at writer and thinker. I believe this is an opportunity to do so. Let's see where this goes! </p>

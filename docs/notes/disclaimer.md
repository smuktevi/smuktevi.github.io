### Dear Readers, 02.08.2023

<p class="initial-letter">
<span>I</span> must say, after making it this far, I still feel like things are just beginning for me. I have so much more to learn and experience along this journey while building out my career brick by brick. I'm grateful that I have more room to grow and I'm confident in my abilities to do so. I wouldn't call myself an expert in data science, software, technology or the IT industry. I just think it's fun and exciting and I'm happy to be a part of this fast-paced evolving data tech world. I just want to understand it better and share that with everyone. I have imposter syndrome daily - just gives me more fuel to work extra hard. I'm doing this to assess my understanding and articulate that in my writing. I believe it will help me become a better writer. </p>

<p>I want to make it clear that all my material on this website is made accessible so that I can maybe help start a discussion here, get some feedback there and learn a little everywhere. So if I make a mistake, do call me out. If you like what you read, buy me a coffee by clicking the link I've hidden on my profile picture on the home page of this website or interact with me in the comments. If you're here to learn with me I'm grateful that you chose my website and hope that you may leave with something valuable gained. </p>

<p>Growing up I was taught to write and learn. It helps me reflect on my understanding of things and shows me how much I retain. For the longest time I thought I didn't have enough information to share with anyone so I put it off. I think I'll just start somewhere and see where it takes me. The first challenge would be to find a regular cadence with this. Let's see where this goes! </p>

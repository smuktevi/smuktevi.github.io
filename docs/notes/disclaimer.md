# Dear Readers,
***02/08/2023***

<p class="initial-letter">
<span>I</span> must say, after making it this far, I still feel like things are just beginning for me. I have so much more to learn and experience along this journey while building out my career brick by brick. I'm grateful that I have more room to grow and I'm confident in my abilities to do so. I wouldn't call myself an expert in data science, software, technology or the IT industry. I just think it's fun and interesting. I'm happy to be a part of this fast-paced ever-evolving data tech world. I want to share my thoughts and learnings on it with everyone. </p>

<p> I used to read a lot of books as a kid. As life changed for me, I had to grow in an environment where I had less or restricted access to books, TV and the internet. I had to cope using the one thing that couldn't be taken away, my imagination. For the longest time I've wanted to share my experiences, thoughts, understandings and learnings to see if any of it resonated with other people and to keep an account of my journey. </p>

<p> I want to become a better thinker. A platform where I can reflect on things coming out of my mind should be a good training ground. Please feel free to correct me where I'm wrong and teach me where I lack sufficient understanding. If you're here to learn or understand my experiences, I appreciate your time in doing so. Any feedback is welcome.  </p>

<span>B</span>uilding the right solutions for a problem at hand has become increasingly important to me as a data professional. With all the hype surrounding data science and AI in today's world it's important for me to ask; do we even need data science here or is the solution much simpler. Today I work as a data scientist helping stakeholders really define their problems comprehensively before diving into my arsenal of skills to provide them with a solution.

The power of data in today's world is ubiquitous. It's not even just about who can accumulate the most amount of data but more about who can extract the most valuable information. Using this valuable information to uncover useful facts and communicating those facts to those who seek it is a data professional's calling.</p>

<p>Imagining and building things from the ground up is extremely satisfying. I think that the satisfaction of seeing something take shape and function straight from the mind is amazing. I'm happy that I have a lot more to learn and experience while on this journey as a data and software professional and I will strive to build and learn more along this path. </p>

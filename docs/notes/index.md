# Notes
***Ramblings, thoughts, TILs and more.***

<p class="initial-letter">
<span>I</span> want to make it clear that all my material on this website is made accessible so that I can maybe help start a discussion here, get some feedback there and learn a little everywhere. So if I make a mistake, do call me out. All of these are my own personal thoughts, I don't represent anyone or any organization but myself. </p>

<p> If you like what you read, interact with me in the comments or feedback sections. If you're here to learn with me I'm grateful that you chose my website and hope that you may leave with something valuable gained. If you'd like to support me, buy me a coffee by clicking on my profile picture on the home page of this website.</p> 

<p>Thank you for visiting! </p>

### I'm Sai!
I'm currently a **data scientist** working on the **Microsoft Edge browser**. 

In data science, my opportunities have led me into various areas such as product growth science, heterogeneity analysis, developing ML models and deploying them client-side, user segmentation, user behavior analysis using clustering, model interpretability, social media discussion sentiment analysis, soft sensor modeling and more.

I also deeply enjoy the process of building things from the ground up. I have fun brainstorming new ideas for applications, and I'm always excited to jump into software technology unknown to me.

Outside of work I like to play volleyball, hike and work on fun side projects.

On this site, my intention is to dive deeper into my professional journey and articulate my thoughts as I explore more. Also, I can assure you that all the content on this site is written by me and not some AI.

**Don't hesitate to get in touch.**

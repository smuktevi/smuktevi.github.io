### I'm Sai!

I'm currently a **Data Scientist** working on the **Microsoft Edge browser** in product growth, processing and analyzing large volumes of data coming in from hundreds of millions of users from all over the world. My projects focus on developing product telemetry, features and metrics all in an effort to increase or track growth. I work within the realms of user retention, acquisition, experimentation, churn and segmentation.

I deeply enjoy the process of helping products realize their true growth potential using data. I also have fun brainstorming new ideas for applications and building things from the ground up.

Outside of work I like to play volleyball, dance, hike and work on fun side projects.

#### HEADS UP! ~ I'm hoping to revamp this site with more content later on, but I'm currently working on a couple other things right now. I appreciate your patience!

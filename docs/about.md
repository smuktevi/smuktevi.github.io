## Professional

### I currently

work as a data scientist on the Microsoft Edge browser processing and analyzing data coming in from millions of users from all over the world. I have become increasingly involved with ways to understand our users better in order to provide them with the right features and tools they need to browse the web.

More specifically, I'm part of efforts in building models and deploying them on the client to understand user needs and behavior from client signals for user segmentation. I'm also a part of uncovering heterogeneity effects in our experiments due to user segments that arise because of multiple factors. I help design and reiterate on features and additions in our product. Though my title says data scientist I would place myself more as a data and software professional - finding the sweet spot between working as a data scientist and software engineer.

### Before Microsoft

- I primarily worked as a data science consultant to help businesses in decision science at IBM. Here, I also helped build a financial accounting product as a MEAN stack developer while exploring different career paths in software.
- I interned at a startup called Ntwist as a python machine learning engineer on a project involving soft sensor modeling for a mineral extraction plant's control system data using Deep Belief networks and other such models.
- I also worked on a government contract as a java software developer and production support engineer just to help pay for college.

### I develop

in Python, R and SQL mostly for all my data work  
but more recently I've been coding a lot on chromium src in C++.  
I've also worked on Java during my short contracting stint, and in MATLAB during my internship.  
At IBM, I picked up MEAN stack while helping develop a product prototype.  
With an interest in cloud architecture I completed a certification in AWS as a solutions architect associate.

Apart from all that I ran into a bunch of other software technologies, frameworks and other coding languages that I've tried out in different occasions and had a lot of fun exploring (and still do).

### I studied

Data Science Masters at the University of Washington (Seattle) and graduated in 2022,  
dove into CS during my Bachelors at Ramaiah Institute of Technology (Banglore) and graduated in 2019,  
and did my schooling in a boarding school in rural India.

### I built

a couple side projects along the way:

- One Customer Voice (Microsoft Global Hackathon '22 executive category 2nd place winner)
- Topic-Sentiment Analysis and Relevance System (TSAR) and BEReddiT
- LyriQuest (College Best Project Award)
- RecipEat
- PipedUp
- FixForm
- Exploring the Hunger Project in Africa.
- Exploring the spread of COVID and its effect on government policies across the world.

#### [Luo Mi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luomi) · Research Data Scientist at Meta · April 8, 2022

"I mentored Sai and a few other talented UW Data Science Master student in their final project. The project revolves around automatic Reddit forum text retrieval, sentimental analysis and topic modeling. The team was able to delivery cloud-deployed mature data product capable of Subreddit sentiment/topic analysis, identification of post discussion "toxicity" as well as a few other relevant functionalities using Deep Learning NLP. 

Throughout the execution of the project, Sai impressed me as being highly self-motivated, good with communication and capable of producing concrete results under vague instructions. Sai also has a SWE background which enables him to not only take on analytics role but also capable of delving into the engineering aspect of the Data Science Work. Aside from technical know-how, Sai also has a long-term plan for his career development. From my 1:1 with him, he can clearly articulate what his career interests are and viable paths to reach the goal. For someone relatively new to the realm of DS, this type of forward planning will be a big contributing factor in his eventual success. 

All in all, I think any data science team would be lucky to have him on the team."

#### [Luan Jiang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luan-jiang-75413857) · Data and Applied Scientist at Microsoft · September 29, 2021

"Sai interned on my team at Microsoft during the summer of 2021 and his internship project was a great success. 

Sai has solid technical skills and is a quick learner. As soon as he joined the team, he progressed extremely fast and successfully completed his onboarding within just two weeks. Sai’s project tested him on many fundamental data science concepts such as exploratory data analysis, various tradeoffs of different modeling algorithms, model interpretability and data visualization. Right away, he showed solid foundational knowledge on each of these areas, and he learned and improved on his existing knowledge as time went on. In addition, Sai had to learn how to use Databricks and how to write code in Pyspark in a short amount of time, showing he’s not afraid of challenges and he can learn fast.

Sai also has impressive presentation skills and was able to break down complex topics in a way that can be digested by a non-technical audience. He was very communicative and easy to work with. It was a great experience working with Sai and he would a tremendous asset to any companies."

#### [Chowdary Meenavilli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chowdarymeenavilli) · CEO and Founder at Ntwist · July 21, 2020 

"Venkata Sai has worked for me as an Intern creating artificially intelligent systems to optimize industrial processes. During that time, Sai had gone through rigorous training. His ability to adapt and use the tools he just learnt effectively allowed his work to be highly productive. Sai is also a very hard worker, as he was enrolled in his undergraduate program, which he would attend while working during the weekdays. He was able to manage both the workload from NTWIST and his course while being successful at both. Along with this he was able to co-create a machine learning solution for an industrial process. The final product was able to make better operational decisions relative to the operator and increase profits by 42% of the time. I believe Venkata Sai has the ideal perspective to create machine learning solutions."

# Apart from work

### I watched

a lot of sci-fi movies growing up, was always fascinated by robots, machines, gadgets and imagining the different things that they could do. I was also very intrigued by the different styles of cinema and the intellectual nuances in building out plot and story. I'll mention a couple movies, tv shows and anime I found endearing and exciting here soon.

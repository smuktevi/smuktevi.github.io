## Professional

### I currently

work as a data scientist on the Microsoft Edge browser processing and analyzing data coming in from millions of users from all over the world. I have become increasingly involved with ways to understand our users better in order to provide them with the right features and tools they need to browse the web. I also ensure that the product telemetry we work with is processed in the right way to extract the best quality information we can from it to understand our users, all while respecting their privacy. My projects focus on user retention, acquisition, experimentation, churn and segmentation.

### Before Microsoft

- I primarily worked as a data science consultant to help businesses in decision science at IBM. Here, I also helped build a financial accounting product as a MEAN stack developer while exploring different career paths in software.
- I interned at a startup called Ntwist as a python machine learning engineer on a project involving soft sensor modeling for a mineral extraction plant's control system data using Deep Belief networks and other such models.
- I also worked on a government contract as a java software developer and production support engineer just to help pay for college.

### I develop

in Python, R and SQL mostly for all my data work  
but more recently I've been coding a lot on chromium src in C++.  
I've also worked on Java during my short contracting stint, and in MATLAB during my internship.  
At IBM, I picked up MEAN stack while helping develop a product prototype.  
With an interest in cloud architecture I completed a certification in AWS as a solutions architect associate.

Apart from all that I ran into a bunch of other software technologies, frameworks and other coding languages that I've tried out in different occasions and had a lot of fun exploring (and still do).

### I studied

Data Science Masters at the University of Washington (Seattle) and graduated in 2022,  
dove into CS during my Bachelors at Ramaiah Institute of Technology (Banglore) and graduated in 2019,  
and did my schooling in a boarding school in rural India.

# Apart from work

### I danced

competitively in high school and during my undergrad in college. I choreographed several dances that won prizes during school and also a few that were performed in front of very large audiences broadcasted all over the world. I was part of multiple western style dance groups, also co-founded and successfully lead my own team [TNT](https://www.instagram.com/trinationtroupe/). We participated in intercollegiate competitions across the greater Bengaluru area in India raking up prize money amounting to almost 1,60,000 INR. I also got down for street style battles winning prizes and participated in random cypher sessions which were a ton of fun back in college. I try to keep dancing where I can.

### I play

volleyball, badminton and basketball in competitive levels (school, college and underdog leagues). I love to play.

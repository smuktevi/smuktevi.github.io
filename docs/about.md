### Thoughts - Aug 3 2023

<p class="initial-letter">
<span>B</span>uilding the right solutions for a problem at hand has become increasingly important to me as a data professional. With all the hype surrounding data science and AI in today's world it's important for me to ask; do we even need data science here or is the solution much simpler. Today I work as a data scientist helping stakeholders really define their problems comprehensively before diving into my arsenal of skills to provide them with a solution.

The power of data in today's world is ubiquitous. It's not even just about who can accumulate the most amount of data but more about who can extract the most valuable information. Using this valuable information to uncover useful facts and communicating those facts to those who seek it is a data professional's calling.</p>

<p>Imagining and building things from the ground up is extremely satisfying. I think that the satisfaction of seeing something take shape and function straight from the mind is amazing. I'm happy that I have a lot more to learn and experience while on this journey as a data and software professional and I will strive to build and learn more along this path. </p>

## Professional

### I currently

work as a data scientist on the Microsoft Edge browser. I have become increasingly involved with ways to understand our users better in order to provide them with the right features and tools they need to browse the web.

> - Tim Berners-Lee

More specifically, I'm part of efforts in building models and deploying them on the client to understand user needs and behavior from client signals without having to pull user data into our servers. I'm also a part of uncovering heterogeneity effects in our experiments of great features and additions in our product. Though my title says data scientist I would place myself more as a data and software professional - finding the sweet spot between working as a data scientist and software engineer.

### Before Microsoft

- I worked as a data science consultant to help businesses in decision science at IBM.
- I interned at a startup called Ntwist as a python machine learning engineer on project involving soft sensor modeling for a mineral extraction plant control system using Deep Belief networks.
- Along the way I worked on a government contract as a java software developer to help pay for college.

### I develop

in Python, R and SQL mostly for all my data work  
but more recently I've been coding a lot on chromium src in C++.  
I've also worked on Java during my short contracting stint, and in MATLAB during my internship.  
At IBM, I picked up MEAN stack while helping develop a product prototype.  
With an interest in cloud architecture I completed a certification in AWS as a solutions architect associate.

Apart from all that I ran into a bunch of other software technologies, frameworks and other coding languages that I've tried out in different occasions and had a lot of fun exploring (and still do).

### I studied

Data Science Masters at the University of Washington (Seattle) and graduated in 2022,  
dove into CS during my Bachelors at Ramaiah Institute of Technology (Banglore) and graduated in 2019,  
and did my schooling in a boarding school in rural India.

### I built

a couple side projects along the way:

- One Customer Voice (Micrsoft Global Hackathon '22 executive category 2nd place winner)
- Topic-Sentiment Analysis and Relevance System (TSAR) and BEReddiT
- LyriQuest (College Best Project Award)
- RecipEat
- PipedUp
- FixForm
- Exploring the Hunger Project in Africa.
- Exploring the spread of COVID and its effect on government policies across the world.

# Apart from work

### I watched

a lot of sci-fi movies growing up, was always fascinated by robots, machines, gadgets and imagining the different things that they could do. I was also very intrigued by the different styles of cinema and the intellectual nuances in building out plot and story. I'll mention a couple movies, tv shows and anime I found endearing and exciting here soon.

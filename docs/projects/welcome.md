    <h3>One Customer Voice</h3>
    <h4>Microsoft GLobal Hackathon 2nd Prize Winner</h4>
    <h2 class="initial-letter">O</h2>
    <p>ne Customer Voice, the 2nd prize in Hack for Creating Brand Love for Customers, was a system that utilized a version of the TSAR architecture, that I developed back in college, to ingest social media feedback on Microsoft products and produce a tableau dashboard that could help product customer success managers make better informed decisions and feature engineers reiterate on useful features of the product.</p>

    <h3>TSAR & BEReddiT</h3>
    <h4>UW Capstone Project sponsored by Meta</h4>
    <h2 class="initial-letter">T</h2>
    <p>he TSAR System is a data engineering pipeline that utilizes Natural Language Processing to analyze internet forum discussions. It performs topic modeling, sentiment analysis and measures relevance of comments to discussions to visually represent social media discussions. Here we implement the TSAR pipeline to Reddit data and the resulting implementation is an application we call BEReddiT.</p>

    <h3>Statistical Analysis on Startup Funding Data</h3>
    <h4>UW Applied Statistics Project</h4>
    <h2 class="initial-letter">T</h2>
    <p>his study reviews several questions of interest for entrepreneurs as well as investors about Start-up organizations. We performed our analysis using the Kaggle dataset of the Crunchbase 2014 snapshot, which includes approximated 50,000 companies. We found that the average amount of money raised, and the average number of funding rounds, both vary by industry. We concluded that the average amount of seed money invested is increasing by 13.5% annually. We also found, controversially, that companies that did not have seed rounds are 4 times more likely to have a venture round. Our results should be received with caution, as our dataset included strong survivorship, regional, and market bias.</p>

    <h3>Visualizing The Hunger Project in Africa</h3>
    <h4>UW Data Visualization</h4>
    <h2 class="initial-letter">T</h2>
    <p>his project is an interactive visualization centered around illustrating the organizational activities of The Hunger Project (THP) in Africa. We aim to represent the work done by THP and its journey over the years through a visual storytelling approach. The targeted audience includes potential donors to THP, members of THP, and anyone interested in learning more about THP activities. 
    My biggest take away from this project was learning how to visualize and find patterns in real world data. Often real world data is very messy and incomplete. It is very important that we convey the information that we can understand from the data in a correct representation so as to not misguide viewers or give chances for misinterpretation.

    <h3>LyriQuest</h3>
    <h4>RIT Capstone</h4>
    <h2 class="initial-letter">O</h2>
    <p>ur project aims at enhancing the experience for sound cataloguing by employing methods to further classify music as well as giving a description about the lyrics. People listen to music in order to feel certain emotions and express joy and sadness. This application will help users select music based on their mood. The software uses various modules to fulfill the operating requirements. It employs the help of song fingerprinting, machine learning, and data science in order to recommend songs, draw graphs, and give analysis on the type of music a person listens to based on song lyrics data. Users will have access to a quick description about the topics and emotions in a song so that they can make a quick judgment on whether to include the track on their playlist.

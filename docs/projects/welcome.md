    <p>One Customer Voice, the 2nd prize in Hack for Creating Brand Love for Customers, was a system that utilized a version of the TSAR architecture, that I developed back in college, to ingest social media feedback on Microsoft products and produce a tableau dashboard that could help product customer success managers make better informed decisions and feature engineers reiterate on useful and popular features of the product.</p>

    <p>he TSAR System is a data engineering pipeline that utilizes Natural Language Processing to analyze internet forum discussions. It performs topic modeling, sentiment analysis and measures relevance of comments to discussions to visually represent social media discussions. Here we implement the TSAR pipeline to Reddit data and the resulting implementation is an application we call BEReddiT.</p>

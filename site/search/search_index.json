With all the hype surrounding data science and AI in today's world it's important for me to ask, do we even need data science here or is the solution much simpler. Today I work as a data scientist helping stakeholders really define their problems comprehensively before diving into my arsenal of skills to provide them with a solution. </p> <p>The power of data in today's world is ubiquitous. It's not even just about who can accumulate the most amount of data but more about who can extract the most valuable information from their data. Using this valuable information to uncover useful facts and communicating those facts to those who seek it is a data professional's calling.</p>"},{"location":"about/#i-currently","title":"I currently","text":"<p>work as a data scientist on the Microsoft Edge browser. I have become increasingly involved with ways to understand our users better in order to provide them with the right features and tools they need to browse the web.</p> <p>a web browser is a window to the internet.</p> <p>More specifically, I'm part of efforts in building models and deploying them on the client to understand user needs and behavior from client signals without having to pull user data into our servers. I'm also a part of uncovering heterogeneity effects in our experiments of great features and additions in our product.

I realized that making things from the ground up is extremely satisfying. Although I didn't take the hardware route I still have the ability to make contributions to our virtual world. Whether it's a project that's been done a million times before or if it's not that impressive of a thing, I still think that the satisfaction of seeing something take shape and function straight from the mind is amazing. I'm happy that I have a lot more to learn and experience while on this journey as a data and software professional.</p>"},{"location":"blog/welcome/","title":"TIL","text":""},{"location":"projects/welcome/","title":"do","text":""}]}

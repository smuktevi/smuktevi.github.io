# Neverest
***Sep 27, 2023***

I used to think climbing Mount Everest would be the greatest thing someone could do in their life. If you could climb that mountain, you could probably do anything, right?

What if you work hard? For years, you really struggle and persevere through rigorous training. All in an effort to scale the highest mountain in the world. And when you get to the very top, there's already a hoard of people there. Maybe they are welcoming you. Would you feel happy for having made it with all these people and celebrate with them? Or would you feel ashamed that you were late to the party. Looks like many already did what you thought was the greatest thing you could do. Is there nothing unique about you now? Which should you feel? Which is the "right" feeling to have?

The "right" thing to feel might be joy that there are people at the top, acknowledging you in as one of their own. You can celebrate with them as equals and share stories of achievements through dedication and hard work. This might reinforce a positive outlook and act as a source of motivation for you going forward. All is well, so onward to the next Everest.

What if you feel otherwise? You hate yourself for not being up to the mark, for not being the first one there. You loath the fact that there are so many that have already proven some remarkable feat to be quite easily achievable by many people. You see others only as competition and are not satisfied. You want to be more. Be greater. Onward to the next Everest.

That isn't a great feeling. May be why it's better to look within. Fight and compete with and within yourself. Where only you bear witness to your greatness. But that seems like a superpower. Where happiness comes from within. Something I think a lot of us wish we would be feeling instead. Beating your personal best instead of being the best person.

So which is it? 
Do we fight to be greater on the outside by receiving acknowledgments of success or do we fight within to achieve happiness through simpler satisfaction?

I think one of these comes more naturally to us than the other. One seems like a long road to happiness and the other much shorter.
So I think... happiness is not the goal here?
